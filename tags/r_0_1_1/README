IBus-LibThai
------------

IBus (Intelligent Input Bus) is an input method framework based on
Freedesktop.org D-Bus. The project can be seen at:
  http://code.google.com/p/ibus/

IBus-LibThai is a Thai input method engine for IBus, based on the LibThai
library.

Currently, it provides 3 keyboard layouts internally:
  - Ketmanee
  - Pattachote
  - TIS-820.2538
(Thai XKB symbols are also supported.)

The input method also filters out invalid input sequences with 3 levels of
strictness:
  - Passthrough (no check)
  - Basic Check
  - Srict Check

For applications that support surrounding text retrieval/deletion,
it can also correct the invalid input sequences.

The latest version can be found at:
